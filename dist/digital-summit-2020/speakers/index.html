                              <h3>Can we co-create our way out of this?</h3>
                              <p>COVID-19 has changed the way government, communities, and organisations
                                work. It is the greatest societal change we are likely to experience,
                                and we need to equip our organisations to deal with it. The pandemic
                                didn't come with a playbook, strategic framework, or case study to help
                                us navigate our way through it.</p>
                              <p>But we do have a starting point. I believe co-design is the most useful
                                tool we have to help decision-makers through this crisis. It is a deeply
                                human, community-based approach that can help government transform the
                                way it delivers products and services to better meet the evolving needs
                                of citizens. We can use co-design to leverage the thoughts, feelings,
                                and intuitions at the coal face of this crisis. It can solve many of
                                the issues the government currently faces and only through true participatory
                                collaboration can we forge the best pathway out of this crisis.</p>
                              <p>I have recently completed work on a co-design project aimed at understanding
                                and reacting to the needs of Australians experiencing mental health and
                                wellbeing difficulties during COVID-19. The project produced more than
                                just products and service concepts. It allowed leaders to work in partnership
                                with individuals to fundamentally shift the strategic direction of the
                                organisation.</p>

                              <p>Digital identity is one of the most significant technology trends in the
                                world, for governments, their citizens and the private sector. The number
                                of digital identity schemes offered by governments and the private sector
                                has proliferated over the past five years, and is expected to grow exponentially
                                as the United Nation's push for 'legal identity for all, by 2030' gathers
                                pace.</p>
                              <p>In this panel, Australian and international digital identity leaders will:</p>

                                <li>Compare successful models of national digital identity schemes.</li>
                                <li>Identify the critical elements need to build public trust and drive adoption.</li>

                            <p class="ds-cards__card-intro">Dean of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University</p>
                            <p class="ds-cards__card-text">Elanor is Dean of the College of Engineering and Computer
                              Science at the Australian National University (ANU). She is an established
                              senior academic leader, with Board appointments to Innovation Science Australia,
                              Significant Capital Ventures, Questacon and other government scientific
                              advisory roles. In 2017 she was named an honorary Fellow of Engineers Australia
                              and led the extended Group of Eight (Go8+) Engineering Deans as the first female
                              Chair until 2019. Before she joined the ANU, she was Head of Engineering
                              and IT at University of New South Wales (UNSW). During this time, she helped
                              bring about significant transformation within the School, including setting
                              up UNSW Space and The Australian Centre for Cyber Security. In 2000, she
                              completed her PhD in experimental Quantum Optics at the ANU. Her current
                              research includes the control of quantum systems, and more specifically the
                              interface between theory and applications. In 2009, she completed a
                              Masters of Information Technology, also through the ANU. She was recently
                              selected to provide expert advice to the newly established Global
                              Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. In 2017 she delivered a TEDxSydney
                              Talk on 'Why we need Engineers now more than ever' and later in 2019, co-founded
                              the Engineering for Australia Taskforce to provide expert advice on addressing
                              barriers to women's participation in university engineering programs. As
                              Dean, Elanor does more than contemplate the difference between distinctions
                              and high distinctions. Her innovative thinking has recast engineering and
                              computer science at the ANU with an unprecedented investment to reimagine
                              the way we do things.</p>
