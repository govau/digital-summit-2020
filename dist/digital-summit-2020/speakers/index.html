                              <p>COVID-19 has changed the way government, communities, and organisations
                                work. It is the greatest societal change we are likely to experience,
                                and we need to equip our organisations to deal with it. The pandemic
                                didn't come with a playbook, strategic framework, or case study to help
                                us navigate our way through it.</p>
                              <p>But we do have a starting point. I believe co-design is the most useful
                                tool we have to help decision-makers through this crisis. It is a deeply
                                human, community-based approach that can help government transform the
                                way it delivers products and services to better meet the evolving needs
                                of citizens. We can use co-design to leverage the thoughts, feelings,
                                and intuitions at the coal face of this crisis. It can solve many of
                                the issues the government currently faces and only through true participatory
                                collaboration can we forge the best pathway out of this crisis.</p>
                              <p>I have recently completed work on a co-design project aimed at understanding
                                and reacting to the needs of Australians experiencing mental health and
                                wellbeing difficulties during COVID-19. The project produced more than
                                just products and service concepts. It allowed leaders to work in partnership
                                with individuals to fundamentally shift the strategic direction of the
                                organisation.</p>

                                as the United Nation's push for 'legal identity for all, by 2030' gathers

                              <p>The global pandemic has drastically accelerated transformation and our perceptions of what's possible. Futurists, designers, change-makers and leaders are eager to take advantage of the shifting economic and social landscape to design better futures. We invite you to explore the current drivers and mega-shifts, to design new world scenarios for the future of government. Experimental futures provide us with new tools, methods and frameworks to make sense of this complexity and to understand emerging risks and opportunities to better inform the actions we take today.</p>
                              <p>We've designed this session to empower organisations to consider the future in their decision-making. They can explore a variety of scenarios to solve emerging problems in novel ways to reveal insights into effective actions towards desirable futures. We will introduce participants to a range of futures and scenario-planning methods in a practical setting with a focus on the human services, transport, and education sectors. We also provide an Experimental Futures Playbook for all participants to help bridge learning-to-doing to extend learning beyond the virtual classroom.</p>

                              <p>It's 2025. Sustainability is at the top of the world's agenda, and Australia is conducting a bold policy experiment that rewards households consuming sustainably, through the tax system.</p>
                              <p>You will assume the role of a Digital Ethics Analyst, and work with a small team of peers to reflect on a particularly controversial aspect of the policy design. Your job is to confront a difficult digital ethics dilemma and think through the digital ethics implications.</p>
                              <p>We will introduce you to important ethics concepts and a digital ethics framework that can guide your thinking. But make no mistake: it will not be clear cut, and it will not feel comfortable.</p>

                                we do. Through our digital work program, we co-designed the development
                                of digital tools with highly disadvantaged clients who considered themselves
                                digitally excluded and had challenges engaging with government services.
                                We brought their voice to every step of the design process to improve
                                their experience of getting help. </p>
                              <p>Our clients are often marginalised. Being part of these projects empowered
                                them and made sure their voices were heard and needs met. For many, it
                                was the first time an 'institution' had asked their opinion and encouraged
                                them to share the expertise of their lived experience. </p>
                              <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic did not prevent us from engaging and designing
                                with our clients. We share how to recruit and engage with clients online
                                in a virtual context to maximise their input and engagement.</p>

                              <p>There is no playbook for what we are experiencing. Our teams have had to

                                regular team retros since the pandemic began. This has enabled us to
                                adapt and adjust as a team and promoted transparency and trust among
                                leadership and staff. We have charted team sentiment moving from anxiety
                                in uncertainty, to enjoying the silver linings of working from home,
                                to video call fatigue and a desire to reconnect in person.</p>
                              <p>We want to share the benefits of the team retro. The session will draw
                                on lessons documented in our remote team guide <a href="https://acceleration.team/">https://acceleration.team/</a>,
                                and encourage participants to engage in an abridged live team retro,
                                individually carding up and playing back their own reflections on what

HTT applies behavioural science to product design to help users achieve better health outcomes. Additionally, a no-code approach allowed the initial version of the app to be co-designed, developed and ready for release in two weeks.</p>

                                to the state's hospital switchboards and contact lines. </p>
                              <p>At a time when demand for health-related information has increased exponentially,

                                follow official health guidelines.</p>
                              <p>The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly with new information coming
                                to light on a daily basis. Since its launch, Clevertar has been able

                              <h4>Checking it twice: digital transformation of the naughty and nice list with the Department of Christmas Affairs</h4>
                              <p>In the lead-up to Christmas 2019, the newly established Department of Christmas
                                Affairs (DCA) quickly needed a user-centred website. With looming deadlines
                                and budgetary pressure, the DCA embarked on a rapid design journey which
                                saw the launch of <a href="http://www.christmasaffairs.com">www.christmasaffairs.com</a> on 4 December 2019.</p>
                              <p>Designing and delivering the website was a rollercoaster of setbacks and
                                successes, tragedies and triumphs, heartbreak, and happiness. But by
                                following the DTA's Service Design and Delivery process, the DCA's vision
                                was realised. <a href="http://www.christmasaffairs.com">www.christmasaffairs.com</a> had over 250,000 unique visitors
                                in the 4-week lead-up to Christmas. It was featured in ABC National News,
                                the Canberra Times, Her Canberra, and over 100 syndicated news channels
                                across the USA. It also blew up on social media.</p>
                              <p>While the DCA is not a real government department, the website is real
                                and there are real learnings to share. This presentation provides practical
                                advice on how to (and how not to) design a user-friendly website.</p>
                              <p>The presentation will appeal to product owners, UX designers, and content
                                designers. Anyone working in website design and delivery will leave this
                                presentation with some easy-to-implement tips and tricks to improve their
                                own processes.</p>

                                agencies progress their digital transformation agendas. Governance controls

                                life cycle. This presentation will describe contemporary principles of
                                digital governance through the lens of digital investment life cycle
                                risk and provide practical advice regarding the key governance controls
                                essential to successful digital investment. The presentation will also
                                overview a case study on failed digital investment in the public sector
                                in Queensland and speak to the key independent findings as they relate
                                to a failure in governance.</p>
                              <p>According to a 2019 report from Forbes, 70% of digital transformation programs
                                fail to meet their stated objectives. Understanding and dealing with
                                transformation risk is critical to success; yet few organisations do
                                it well, mostly because they do not understand the risks due to a lack
                                of competency in digital projects and digital business. Digital governance
                                is a key competency for senior manager and executives as we move towards
                                digital government.</p>

                              <p>Behavioural science is the scientific revolution of our day. Never before
                                has there been such a focus on human behaviour and decision making to
                                address the critical challenges we face as a society. This is especially
                                true for workplaces, which are experiencing a massive shift in how they
                                operate, employee expectations, and digitally enabled collaboration.
                                Behavioural sciences offer a new approach to dealing with the complexity
                                of the workplace, by focussing in on human behaviour and dynamics. This
                                behavioural lens is key to understanding and shifting engagement, performance
                                and culture.</p>

                              <h4>Cybersecurity &ndash; increasing cyber resilience above and beyond administrative compliance in 2020</h4>
                              <p>The session will cover a range of highly relevant security topics for government
                                departments. This includes the importance of overarching secure cloud
                                and the successful implementation of risk mitigation strategies and focus
                                on the issues and complexities involved with successfully passing audits
                                and delivering projects and transformations of this nature. The session
                                will also more deeply go beyond becoming merely administratively compliant
                                and focus on increasing overall cyber resilience.</p>
                              <p>A key outcome will be the ability to determine the level of maturity a
                                department is at and increasing visibility into their own cyber security
                                posture and the strategies involved in developing a roadmap for achieving
                                the desired security posture. This approach to remediation involves leveraging
                                the ecosystem of people, processes and emerging technologies to gain
                                compliance, confidence and resilience along with fusing security into

                              Science at the Australian National University (ANU). She is an established
                              senior academic leader, with Board appointments to Innovation Science Australia,
                              Significant Capital Ventures, Questacon and other government scientific
                              advisory roles. In 2017 she was named an honorary Fellow of Engineers Australia
                              and led the extended Group of Eight (Go8+) Engineering Deans as the first female
                              Chair until 2019. Before she joined the ANU, she was Head of Engineering
                              and IT at University of New South Wales (UNSW). During this time, she helped
                              bring about significant transformation within the School, including setting
                              up UNSW Space and The Australian Centre for Cyber Security. In 2000, she
                              completed her PhD in experimental Quantum Optics at the ANU. Her current
                              research includes the control of quantum systems, and more specifically the
                              interface between theory and applications. In 2009, she completed a
                              Masters of Information Technology, also through the ANU. She was recently
                              selected to provide expert advice to the newly established Global
                              Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. In 2017 she delivered a TEDxSydney
                              Talk on 'Why we need Engineers now more than ever' and later in 2019, co-founded
                              the Engineering for Australia Taskforce to provide expert advice on addressing
                              barriers to women's participation in university engineering programs. As
                              Dean, Elanor does more than contemplate the difference between distinctions
                              and high distinctions. Her innovative thinking has recast engineering and
                              computer science at the ANU with an unprecedented investment to reimagine
                              the way we do things.</p>
