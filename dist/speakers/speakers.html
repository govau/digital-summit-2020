                            <p class="ds-cards__card-text">With 15 years of experience in the industry, Ernez has established himself
                              as an experienced design leader. Over the course of his career, Ernez has
                              integrated and established design practices in some of Australia's largest
                              digital and full-service agencies. He has mentored emerging design talent
                              and a new generation of design leaders. He has led large-scale digital
                              strategy and transformation programs across the public, private and social
                              sectors. He has a deep understanding of these sectors and is passionate
                              about helping clients experiment with new ways of working to generate new
                              types of value. Ernez has worked across continents and been an active contributor
                              to the digital culture in Australia across his entire career.</p>

                              <h3>Can we co-create our way out of this?</h3>
                              <p>COVID-19 has changed the way government, communities, and organisations
                                work. It is the greatest societal change we are likely to experience,
                                and we need to equip our organisations to deal with it. The pandemic
                                didn't come with a playbook, strategic framework, or case study to help
                                us navigate our way through it.</p>
                              <p>But we do have a starting point. I believe co-design is the most useful
                                tool we have to help decision-makers through this crisis. It is a deeply
                                human, community-based approach that can help government transform the
                                way it delivers products and services to better meet the evolving needs
                                of citizens. We can use co-design to leverage the thoughts, feelings,
                                and intuitions at the coal face of this crisis. It can solve many of
                                the issues the government currently faces and only through true participatory
                                collaboration can we forge the best pathway out of this crisis.</p>
                              <p>I have recently completed work on a co-design project aimed at understanding
                                and reacting to the needs of Australians experiencing mental health and
                                wellbeing difficulties during COVID-19. The project produced more than
                                just products and service concepts. It allowed leaders to work in partnership
                                with individuals to fundamentally shift the strategic direction of the
                                organisation.</p>

                              <p>Service 4.0 is a way for governments to reframe their large investments in service transformation into a strategy.
