          <h4>Agility accelerator</h4>
          <p>Today 'agile' is no longer just a buzzword. From building spacecraft to
            manufacturing, some of the most complex and largest organisations in
            the world are using agile ways of working to deliver better outcomes,
            respond to change, improve quality, foster more productive and happier
            teams, and reduce risk.</p>
          <p>This hands-on and interactive session is aimed at helping public sector
            organisations build capability to support agile ways of working, from
            policy development through to service design and delivery.</p>
          <p>Participants will have access to resources and materials to help accelerate
            capability building within their own organisations.</p>
