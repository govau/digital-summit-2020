        <p class="ds-cards__card-text">Anthony is Future Friendly's Policy Design Director and leads their Canberra
          studio where they partner with government to find ways to move forward
          with complex projects with greater confidence. He developed his experience
          in citizen-centric policy and service design over many years working across
          Commonwealth, state and territory, local government and not-for-profits.
          This experience ranges from applying design thinking to shape more responsive
          youth justice and family and domestic violence policies, to user research
          and program management as part of major digital transformation projects.
          Before he joined Future Friendly he worked as a senior executive in a strategic
          management consulting firm for over a decade. He is passionate about social
          justice and has been an Indigenous Community Volunteer for over a decade.
          He is privliged to have volunteered on numerous community-driven projects
          in communities such as the Torres Strait, Aputula, Alice Springs and Condobolin.</p>

          <h4>The team retro: reflecting on working from home</h4>
          <p>There is no playbook for what we are experiencing. At Future Friendly, teams have had to
            adapt to a new normal overnight. They have been running
            regular team retros since the pandemic began. This has enabled them to
            adapt and adjust as a team, and has promoted transparency and trust among
            leadership and staff. They have charted team sentiment moving from anxiety
            in uncertainty, to enjoying the silver linings of working from home,
            to video call fatigue and a desire to reconnect in person.</p>
          <p>Anthony and Saakshi will share the benefits of the team retro. They will draw
            on lessons documented in their remote team guide <a href="https://acceleration.team/">https://acceleration.team/</a>,
            and encourage participants to engage in an abridged live team retro,
            individually carding up and playing back their own reflections on what
            has and hasn't worked well for them.</p>
