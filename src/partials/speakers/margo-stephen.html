          <h3>Panel: A global perspective on Digital Identity</h3>
          <p>Digital identity is one of the most significant technology trends in the
            world, for governments, their citizens and the private sector. The number
            of digital identity schemes offered by governments and the private sector
            has proliferated over the past five years, and is expected to grow exponentially
            as the United Nation's push for 'legal identity for all, by 2030' gathers
            pace.</p>
          <p>In this panel, Australian and international digital identity leaders will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compare successful models of national digital identity schemes.</li>
            <li>Identify the critical elements need to build public trust and drive adoption.</li>
            <li>Discuss the benefits from international interoperability.</li>
          </ul>
