          <h4>How human transformation technology is empowering governments and service providers to deliver rapid mobile mental health responses during COVID-19</h4>
          <p>To address the burden on health workers' mental health during COVID-19, leaders in technology and clinical care collaborated to deliver The Essential Network, an Australian government-funded mobile app providing specialist mental health advice and triaged support.</p>
          <p>The solution is technologically innovative in two ways. The app was developed on Cogniss, an Application Platform as a Service (APaaS) for creating Human Transformation Technology (HTT) solutions. HTT applies behavioural science to product design to help users achieve better health outcomes. Additionally, a no-code approach allowed the initial version of the app to be co-designed, developed and ready for release in two weeks.</p>
