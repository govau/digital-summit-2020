          <h4>How one team rapidly delivered drought, bushfire and COVID-19 crisis support to NSW citizens</h4>
          <p>Faced with the drought, bushfires, and COVID-19, the NSW State Government
            needed to rapidly support affected citizens.</p>
          <p>Tom will speak to how a persistent, cross-functional team in Service
            NSW were able to understand what citizens really needed and come
            back to home base to deliver it in weeks, rather than months. The case study
            is backed by how the work happened, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>human-centred design in the field, not the desk</li>
            <li>the practice, not theory, of lean and agile development</li>
            <li>pairing to build capability in Service NSW using Extreme Programming.</li>
          </ul>
