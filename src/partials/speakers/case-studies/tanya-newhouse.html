          <h4>From overwhelmed phone lines to SA Health's first virtual employee. How we built virtual agent Zoe in 6 days to respond to COVID-19</h4>
          <p>Designed by Clevertar and SA Health's team, Zoe was built and launched in 6 days to help SA Health respond to a
            surge in COVID-19-related questions to the state's hospital switchboards and contact lines. </p>
          <p>At a time when demand for health-related information has increased exponentially, Zoe is working around-the-clock
            to answer questions and help South Australians follow official health guidelines.</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly with new information coming to light on a daily basis. Since its launch,
            Clevertar has been able to re-train Zoe and deploy new conversations in a matter of days.</p>
