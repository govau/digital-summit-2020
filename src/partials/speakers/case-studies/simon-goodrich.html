          <h4>amica.gov.au &mdash; a digital solution for separating couples</h4>
          <p>Portable and National Legal Aid have recently launched <a href="https://amica.gov.au">amica.gov.au</a>            - a tool to help couples separate without the need for a lawyer. It leverages
            co-design, intuitive content and artificial intelligence to help people
            resolve their dispute themselves. This has resulted from 3 years
            user testing and agile development. Since being launched by the Federal
            Attorney-General on June 30 2020, over 1000 people have started this
            process, with agreements already being made between parties. Amica is
            an initiative of Portable that aligns with its mission to provide government
            services that meet and exceed the expectations of citizens.</p>
