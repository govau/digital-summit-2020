          <h4>National Bushfire Recovery Agency</h4>
          <p>Rina from the National Bushfire Recovery Agency will speak about the establishment of the Agency following the Black Summer bushfires. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Agency took its bushfire recovery efforts online and used its unique position to create a presence that cuts through red-tape, promotes transparency, and directly connects people with the help they need. They continue to deliver support to bushfire-affected people and stay true to their mantra, that is, if they don't know the answer, they'll connect you with someone who does.</p>
