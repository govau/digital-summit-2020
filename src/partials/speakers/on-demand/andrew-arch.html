          <h4>Desigining for people with cognitive impairments</h4>
          <p>When considering disability as part of the diversity of people we need
            to do research with and design for, we often only consider the more visible
            disabilities and impairments of vision, hearing and mobility. Cognition,
            often considered a 'hidden disability', can easily be overlooked. Digital
            design and language choices can make content inaccessible to people with
            cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
          <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have been accused of
            not sufficiently including the needs of people with cognitive and learning
            disabilities. To address this, the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities
            Accessibility Task Force  was formed, with its objectives including the
            creation of new criteria for WCAG 2.2, due at the end of 2020. However,
            as not everything that might help this group can be defined in terms
            of pass/fail criteria, a note on 'Making Content Usable for People with
            Cognitive and Learning Disabilities' has also been produced. It includes
            a design guide to support researchers and designers to provide better
            experiences for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
