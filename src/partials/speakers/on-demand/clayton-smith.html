          <h4>Checking it twice: digital transformation of the naughty and nice list with the Department of Christmas Affairs</h4>
          <p>In the lead-up to Christmas 2019, the newly established Department of Christmas
            Affairs (DCA) quickly needed a user-centred website. With looming deadlines
            and budgetary pressure, the DCA embarked on a rapid design journey which
            saw the launch of <a href="http://www.christmasaffairs.com">www.christmasaffairs.com</a> on 4 December 2019.</p>
          <p>Designing and delivering the website was a rollercoaster of setbacks and
            successes, tragedies and triumphs, heartbreak, and happiness. But by
            following the DTA's Service Design and Delivery process, the DCA's vision
            was realised. <a href="http://www.christmasaffairs.com">www.christmasaffairs.com</a> had over 250,000 unique visitors in the 4-week lead-up to Christmas.
            It was featured in ABC National News, the Canberra Times, Her Canberra,
            and over 100 syndicated news channels across the USA. It also blew up
            on social media.</p>
          <p>While the DCA is not a real government department, the website is real
            and there are real learnings to share. This presentation provides practical
            advice on how to (and how not to) design a user-friendly website.</p>
          <p>The presentation will appeal to product owners, UX designers, and content
            designers. Anyone working in website design and delivery will leave this
            presentation with some easy-to-implement tips and tricks to improve their
            own processes.</p>
