          <h4>How systems thinking can enhance your design thinking</h4>
          <p>The philosophies of design thinking and systems thinking are complementary
            and not mutually exclusive.</p>
          <p>Design thinking refers to applying a designer's sensibility and methods
            to problem solving, no matter what the problem is. Systems thinking is
            a complementary framework that sees relationships, rather than things.
            It can help in identify 'patterns of change' and how we can adjust a
            system to cause the most effective change.</p>
          <p>Systems thinking can enhance the design process. It provides a diagnostic
            toolkit to put the problem in its appropriate context. Applicable to
            user experience, customer experience, and human-centred design, systems thinking helps examine the problem more holistically
            and accurately before acting and jumping into conclusions.</p>
          <p>Garrett will share 6 basic systems thinking tools you can apply
            immediately in a design thinking framework and a wider context. He will
            also share examples of applying some of these tools in the government
            and private sector.</p>
