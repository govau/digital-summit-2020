          <h4>Australia.gov.au &mdash; COVID-19 crisis response</h4>
          <p>On 17 March, there were 453 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia &mdash;
            more than double what it had been only 3 days earlier. With a national
            emergency on the horizon, the Australian Government needed a communications
            channel to deliver clear and consistent messages.</p>
          <p>The DTA worked closely with PM&amp;C to deliver the communications platform,
            with Deloitte Digital as our primary partner. With a team of over 40
            people working remotely, we leveraged rapid prototyping design methodologies
            and strong cross-agency collaboration to build and launch a new australia.gov.au
            COVID-19 crisis homepage in under 6 hours.</p>
