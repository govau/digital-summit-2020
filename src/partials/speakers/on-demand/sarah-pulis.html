            years of experience (10 years isn't bad though, right?). She founded
            Intopia 4 years ago after working with PwC Australia and Media Access
            Australia. She also participates in the Education Outreach Working
            Group of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative. She is the founder of
            A11y Bytes and A11Y Camp, which have grown to be Australia's largest
            events on digital accessibility and inclusion.</p>
            <p><strong>Sarah is co-presenter for 'Accessibility considerations for ICT procurement &ndash; ensuring staff and citizens can use the systems government buys, adapts or builds'.</strong></p>
