          <h4>Airservices Optimal Reality &mdash; digital twin of the skies</h4>
          <p>The aviation industry is entering the most disruptive decade since the
            first powered flight. Airservices Australia is investing to be ready.
            </p>
          <p>Deloitte Digital and Airservices Australia developed a digital twin of
            Australian airspace that ingests live flight data and simulates forward
            faster than real time. It simulates thousands of possible outcomes every
            minute, optimising to the best one. Initial results indicate significant
            operational benefits and a transformation in how they innovate and deliver
            for the future.</p>
          <p>Bringing Formula 1 thinking, human-centred design, and cutting-edge technology
            the team created an accurate, performant digital twin and a range of
            customer-centric apps to improve decision-making across the industry.</p>
