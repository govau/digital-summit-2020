          <h4>Digital governance &ndash; what it is and why it is critical to the future of digital government</h4>
          <p>Mal will focus on the importance of digital governance as
            agencies progress their digital transformation agendas. Governance controls
            are critical to address risks that emerge throughout the digital investment
            life cycle. Mal will describe contemporary principles of
            digital governance through the lens of digital investment life cycle
            risk, and provide practical advice regarding the key governance controls
            essential to successful digital investment. He will also proivide an
            overview of a case study on failed digital investment in the public sector
            in Queensland and speak to the key independent findings as they relate
            to a failure in governance.</p>
          <p>According to a 2019 report from Forbes, 70% of digital transformation programs
            fail to meet their stated objectives. Understanding and dealing with
            transformation risk is critical to success, yet few organisations do
            it well, mostly because they do not understand the risks due to a lack
            of competency in digital projects and digital business. Digital governance
            is a key competency for senior manager and executives as we move towards
            digital government.</p>
