          <h4>Airservices Optimal Reality &mdash; digital twin of the skies</h4>
          <p>The aviation industry is entering the most disruptive decade since the
            first powered flight. Airservices Australia is investing to be ready.
            </p>
          <p>Deloitte Digital and Airservices Australia developed a digital twin of Australian airspace that ingests live flight
            data and simulates forward faster than real time. It simulates thousands
            of possible outcomes every minute, optimising to the best one. Initial
            results indicate significant operational benefits and a transformation
            in how they innovate and deliver for the future.</p>
          <p>Bringing Formula 1 thinking, human-centred design, and cutting-edge technology
            the team created an accurate, performant digital twin and a range of customer-centric
            apps to improve decision-making across the industry.</p>
