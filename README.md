# Digital Summit 2020
This repository holds code for the Digital Summit 2020 website. The EventsAir platform hosts the HTML and related files.

## Updating the site
It is a simple matter - at the moment - of copying and pasting new code into the EventsAir user interface.

## Future plans
- A better way of updating EventsAir, probably using an API of some kind
- Connected to the above, a content API hosted in a Drupal website on cloud.gov.au
